Do you know what's frustrating? You're watching a film that's got a really interesting central idea, and you really want to get into it, but you just can't quite get there because no matter how good that idea is, if the execution is bad then there's just no saving it.

The Hunt doesn't have this problem.

The Hunt claims to be a Horror Action film. A group of strangers wake up in an open field with no knowledge of where they are or why they are there. It is quickly revealed that they have been kidnapped group of rich elites who have taken them to a manor so that they can be hunted for sport. We follow this group as they fight for their survival and uncover the truth behind why they were chosen.

A classic, if perhaps tired, setup to a horror action film then, and for the most part the execution (pun obviously intended) is solid. The direction and moment to moment editing do a great job, especially at the start of the movie, of putting you in the disorientating and frenetic position of our protagonists. The fight choreography and cinematography are consistently impressive, and the special effects are... well they're not fantastic but they're incredible given the film's mid to low budget.

The problems, unfortunately, start to creep in with the writing. It's pretty hard to discuss why without going into at least mild spoiler territory so if all you're reading this review for is to hear my yay or nay then I'll save you skipping to the end and tell you 3/5 stars, you're better off watching something else, have a nice day.

Are they gone?

Good. Now let's go first act spoilers.

If you're even mildly paying attention, you'll quickly realise this isn't just your traditional class warfare struggle. Remember kids, the true horror of modern American society is the growing political divide. These true blue (or perhaps more accurately red) everyday republicans are being hunted by the evil rich liberal democrat elite.

Now, you may be thinking: Aren't most movies these days written by liberals and for a mostly liberal audience? Well yes my dear reader, and in there lies the root of the problem here. This film centrally about the political divide seems to be incredibly undecided as to what its politics actually are.

The film is pretty toothless in its satirical portrayal of our liberal villains. Relying on very clunky dialogue to name check a few common left wing talking points like climate change and gun control without daring to attempt any deeper critique of their worldview or even trying to link said worldview to their murderous acts. The film never tries to explain the antagonistsâ€™ actions or ideas any further than "I hate them and want them dead because they're right wing", which is perhaps unintentionally the only effective piece of satirical commentary of the entire film.

The biggest problem however is the writing and framing of the protagonists. The film seems very proud of its core twist. Seemingly gleeful that it was able to get you, the audience, to sympathise with these people before pulling back the curtain on who they really are. As if this reveal should preclude them from compassion or pity for their situation. However, the film is consistently either unwilling or unable to empathise with our hunted republicans. Many of the death scenes have a darkly comedic tone, despite the rest of the film not really ever being funny. The hunted are largely written to be a group of ignorant selfish bigots. Which leaves the film in a confused limbo of simultaneously expecting us to care while also framing these characters in such a way that we feel nothing for them.

This unfortunately holds true for our main protagonist Crystal played by Betty Gilpin, who is spectacular while in her action heroine role during the fight scenes as previously stated but is flat and uninteresting the rest of the time. However, I am reluctant to blame Betty for this when I've got the writer and director right there who planned out the rest of this mess.

Crystal is the one character who we don't really hear any strong political view out of, she usually just sits disinterested while other characters preach their views at her. Leading to a main character who disengages you from the themes of the film while also having little agency as she is flung around trying to survive. Being the only capable and trained fighter in the plot she also appears to be disinterested in the danger she finds herself in. The movie falls into the standard trope hole of not really knowing how to write a female action lead in any other way than making her constantly cold, emotionless, and competent. This all adds up to a lead who is entirely uninterested in the stakes, the plot, and the themes. This disinterest ends up being infectious. 

The one decision Crystal does make is to continue trying to kill those who did this to her rather than simply attempting an escape; and even this she appears to only choose because the plot demands it. This all culminates in a final encounter which is the perfect conclusion of this film in that while having some impressive choreography and decently shot action it is ultimately made uninteresting by being in service to these poorly written characters and plot.

3/5 stars
